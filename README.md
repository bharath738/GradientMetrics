We have a paper in preparation but are waiting until I am finished with an analogous open source option as well. I am currently working on a R package that uses SAGA for the raster processing engine. The SAGA option has the smallest footprint from a software standpoint. Many of the metrics available in this toolbox are also available in the spatialEco R package, using the raster package for the raster processing.
